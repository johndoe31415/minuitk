# minuitk
minuitk is a minimal UI toolkit that can be used to show extremely simple UIs
with little overhead and without an X server. It presents the programmer with
an extremely rudimentary abstration and essentially acts as glue code between
libcairo and libSDL2. You therefore can software render into a cairo surface
and then display everything.
